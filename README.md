# flutter_assessment

This is a short exercise for candidates applying to join the Flutter team at
Superlist. 

Please spend 2-3 hours on this challenge. We don't expect a perfect solution,
just try your best to put together something decent within the time constraint
:)

## The Goal

You are given a bunch of tasks. Each `Task` belongs to a list of tasks, known as
a `TaskList`. Each task has a title, a list of tags, and possibly a due date.

Create an app that allows you to group the list of tasks in different ways: no
grouping, group by due date, group by tag, and group by `TaskList`.

  - Each Group should have a heading
    - If no grouping is selected, do not display any headings
    - If grouped by `TaskList`, the heading should be the title of the
      `TaskList`
    - If grouped by due date, the heading should be "Overdue", "Today",
      "Tomorrow", "Later", or "No Due Date‚Äù
    - If grouped by `Tag`, the heading should be the name of the Tag, or "No
      Tag"
  - Clicking on a heading should hide the tasks underneath that heading

Please see `demo.mov` or `demo.gif` as an example.

## How to complete the assessment

  - This project contains some skeleton code with sample data
  - Start by initiating a git repository with an "Initial Commit."
  - Work on the challenge for 2-3 hours.
  - When you are finished, commit your solution. If you prefer creating smaller
    commits along the way, please feel free to do so.
  - Zip the directory up and send it back to us via Recruitee.
  - Feel free to reach out if you have questions :)
